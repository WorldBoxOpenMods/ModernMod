# ModernMod

ModernMod is a content mod made for WorldBox using NML that adds higher level building upgrades to the game, both for the 4 base game races and any modded ones which the player might have.

## Building

The project, as uploaded on this repo, cannot be built out of the box. It assumes that all of it's dependency DLLs like NML and a publicised Assembly-CSharp.dll file are located within a Libraries directory in the parent directory of ModernMod.
Note that being able to build it isn't necessary for loading the mod into your game, since NML compiles mods on the fly.
